File Descriptions:

gather_script.py:

The gather_script.py file was used to gather all of our transactions from 11-12-18 to 11-18-18. Every 30 seconds, it pulls the
JSON code from the Venmo Public API, which includes 20 transactions, and writes it to a JSON file. In total this created around 
20,000 individual files. We then merged all of these files together into one file, called merged_filebig.JSON.

merged_filebig.JSON:

This file contains around 397,000 transactions from 11-12-18 to 11-18-18, and can be found on outlook where we sent it to you. 
It was too big to upload onto github

analyze_script.py:

This is the file which contains all of our Python analysis scripts. We were able to run this file over merged_filebig.JSON on IDLE. 
To run it on your machine, there may be issues with the libraries according to which version of Python you are running or your OS.
If the libraries load in fine, then just put analyze_script.py and merged_filebig.JSON in the same directory, and run analyze_script.py 
in your IDE of choice. (We used IDLE). Running it should cause no memory issues, and afterwards you can see some of the results we 
recieved printed on the IDE, or you can call the variables where we saved the results. So for example, if you wanted to see the top
hundred Emojis unicodes, just enter in topHundredEmojis into the IDE. If you want to find a certain day, then topHundredEmojisSat etc.

We took the data this returned and placed it into Excel to make graphs and analyze data easier.
